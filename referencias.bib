  abstract = {Quantum walks have been actively studied from many perspectives, mainly from the statistical physics and quantum information points of view. We here determine the influence of basic chaotic features on the walker behavior. We consider an extremely simple model consisting of alternate one-dimensional walks along the two spatial coordinates of bidimensional closed domains (hard wall billiards). The chaotic or regular behavior that the shape of the boundary induces in the deterministic classical equations of motion and that translates into chaotic signatures for the quantized problem also results in sharp differences for the spectral statistics and morphology of the eigenfunctions of the quantum walker. This includes the presence of scarring on unstable periodic orbits of the Hamiltonian system. Unexpectedly, two different quantum mechanical problems share the same kind of features related to the corresponding classical dynamics of one of them.},

  abstract = {We derive expressions for the probability distribution of the ratio of two consecutive level spacings for the classical ensembles of random matrices. This ratio distribution was recently introduced to study spectral properties of many-body problems, as, contrary to the standard level spacing distributions, it does not depend on the local density of states. Our Wigner-like surmises are shown to be very accurate when compared to numerics and exact calculations in the large matrix size limit. Quantitative improvements are found through a polynomial expansion. Examples from a quantum many-body lattice model and from zeros of the Riemann zeta function are presented.},
